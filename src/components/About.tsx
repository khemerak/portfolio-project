        I am a Computer Science graduate and IT professional with a knack for solving problems. With a strong command of ReactJS, PHP, and Python, I combine software development skills with practical IT operations knowledge, including Linux administration and AWS cloud hosting. When I'm not coding or managing systems, you can find me staying active on the football field or keeping up with the latest tech trends.
